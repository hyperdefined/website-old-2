    <h2 id="subtitle">Minecraft Plugins</h2>
    <p>I focus on developing and maintaining Minecraft server plugins. I have decent expierence with running servers as well.</p>
    <p>You can find my plugins on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/hyperdefined.599050/">Spigot</a>, <a href="https://hangar.papermc.io/hyperdefined">Hangar</a>, and my <a href="https://github.com/hyperdefined?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>. There's too many to list here.</p>
    <p>I usually make plugins that are for specific needs or ones I haven't seen done yet.</p>
