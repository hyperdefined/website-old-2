I never thought I would be interested in getting a fursuit, but here we are! But what pushed me to get myself a fluffy suit?

My first furry convention was Anthrocon 2022. I decided to go last minute with a friend. Around this time was when I really go into the furry fandom. I've been in the fandom for well over a decade, but I've never been actively involved. I only got my fursona created in December of 2021. Back then, I was only interested in the art side of the fandom, not suiting.

My first initial impressions of the convention were life changing. I've never seen a fursuit in person before, and it was awesome. The convention itself was very overwhelming. However, the best part was the fursuit parade.

During that convention, there is a parade that is hosted outside for people to come and watch. It's funny seeing non-furry people there. That parade was life changing for me. I told my friend that I wanted to be in that parade next year. I wanted to get a fursuit. Seeing how much fun people were having and how awesome they looked fully convinced me.

I went on vacation afterwards and soon started to look for fursuit makers during that time. I soon realized how impossible it was to find someone who was open. Everyone seemed to be closed, and I was eager to start the process. Hell, I would have paid someone right away if they could start on it. However, I had to be patient and continue my search.

I was not looking for a full-body suit, as that was too much for me. I really like how partials looked on the body, mainly sleeves. I also didn't want to spend my entire savings on it. I submitted forms to be quoted to a few people, but never heard back from them. Some even required me to pay for them to investigate it, which was surprising to me. Eventually, I gave up my search and switched to "the right person will come." I even sent out a tweet asking for makers. However, I only got scammers to reply to me which I find funny. There's apparently a lot out there.

After my first search failed, I stopped looking for a while. However, I found someone from TikTok who posted their maker in their bio, and I decided to check them out. To my surprise, their prices were very low, and it included everything I wanted. On July 11th, 2022, my fursuit journey started.

I messaged the maker, and we talked a bit back and forth. They didn't reply the quickest, but I was patient. Eventually, she moved over to Telegram to chat and discuss payment. Because of her location, I was not able to use PayPal or any major payment companies. I had to use Boosty, which is the only way for her. I was a bit taken back, since the site was weird, but I decided to go all in and sent my first payment to her. I was added to the queue, and it turned into the waiting game. This was August of 2022.

I was hoping to have it started before 2023, but I didn't hear anything for months at a time and decided to check in. My spot was moving, and things were looking good.

At the beginning of April 2023, I got the best news of my life. It was finally my turn in the queue!
