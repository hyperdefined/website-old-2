My fursuit progress start in the summer of 2022. I recently went to Anthrocon, and I was super inspired to commission a suit. I ended up getting my fursuit in May of 2023. The original suit was made by [Fur_rain/fil_fur](https://www.instagram.com/fil_fur/). They have changed their name many times.

### Parts
I've replaced the some of the original pieces of my suit. They've been replaced mainly from being low quality or sizing issues.
