## Projects
Collection of things I currently work on or manage.
### Minecraft Plugins
I focus on developing and maintaining Minecraft server plugins. I have  expierence with running servers as well.

You can find my plugins on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/hyperdefined.599050/), [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/hyperdefined), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/hyperdefined), and my [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperdefined?tab=repositories). There's too many to list here.

I usually make plugins that are for specific needs or ones I haven't seen done yet.
### Java
These are standalone Java projects that aren't for anything specific.
* [CustomLauncherRewrite](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CustomLauncherRewrite) - A fully standalone custom launcher for Toontown Rewritten.
* [GitHubReleaseAPI](https://github.com/hyperdefined/GitHubReleaseAPI) - A simple and small library for accessing GitHub releases for a repository.

## Websites
I run some other websites for people or myself.
* [ardenwolfsky.com](https://ardenwolfsky.com) - Personal website for friend, built using Jekyll.
