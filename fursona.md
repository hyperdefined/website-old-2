### Fursuit
My fursuit progress start in the summer of 2022 after I went to Anthrocon. I was super inspired to commission a suit. I ended up getting my fursuit in May of 2023. The original suit was made by [Fur_rain/fil_fur](https://www.instagram.com/fil_fur/). They have since changed their name many times.
